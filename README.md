# Quantitative Gait Analysis From RGB Videos Using a Dual-Input Transformer-Based Network

## Overview
This repository is the official implementation for the research "Quantitative Gait Analysis From RGB Videos Using a Dual-Input Transformer-Based Network". In this paper, we present an innovative and efficient method for clinical gait analysis through a dual-pattern input convolutional transformer network. Our system leverages a dual-input Transformer model to estimate essential gait parameters from RGB video captured by a single-view camera. It demonstrates high accuracy in predicting critical metrics such as the Gait Deviation Index (GDI), knee flexion angle, step length, and walking cadence, validated on a dataset of individuals with movement disorders.
